        <p> I've previously taken two college classes dealing with computers, and learned the essentials of visual basic.
        I assisted a school in with their computer systems updates by setting up 200 new computers and re-imaging all of them
        using an open source FOG software.  I ran a business during highschool in which I edited and created movies for people using
        various computer programs. </p>

        <!-- <p> will start a new paragraph that will contain my calling, with the paragraph being ended by the tag </p> -->
        <p> I feel that, after college, God is calling me to move to New York City, and work there as a computer scientist,
        particularly in the field of information security.  I've been to the city before and felt that it was truly my place of
        calling.  I have no idea what God want's me to do ministry wise there, but I am certain that everything will work out in 
        His favor. </p>
